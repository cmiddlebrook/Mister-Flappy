# Mister Flappy - A Unity 6 Tutorial Project
Mister Flappy is a simple implementation of a Flappy Bird type game built for a free beginner tutorial which will be available both on Udemy and YouTube. I'll post links to both of those resources here when they are live.

You can play the game in your browser on [Itch](https://rheyan.itch.io/mister-flappy) and the tutorial videos will be posted here when they go live.
